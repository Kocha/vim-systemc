INTRODUCTION

These scripts do the syntax highlighting for SystemC files.
(In the future, various functions are added.)

==============================================================================
USAGE

If the syntax of the file is detected to be cpp, the first
50 lines are scanned for some systemc specific keywords. If
found, systemc highlighting is added, else the normal cpp
highlighting is left
